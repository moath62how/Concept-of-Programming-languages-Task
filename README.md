# Concept of Programming Languages - Task Solutions

This repository contains solutions to three programming problems assigned as part of the **Concept of Programming Languages** course. The problems are solved using Python, and the solutions demonstrate various programming concepts covered during the course.

## Problems and Solutions

### 1. Daily Steps Tracker
- **Description**: 
  - Accepts the number of steps taken each day in a month as input.
  - Calculates the highest and lowest step counts.
  - Calculates the average daily step count.
  - Sorts the step counts in descending order.
- **Concepts Used**:
  - Lists
  - User input handling
  - Arithmetic operations
  - Sorting
- **Solution File**: [`daily_steps_tracker.py`](./daily_steps_tracker.py)

### 2. Library Book Borrowing Analysis
- **Description**:
  - Accepts a list of borrowed books with the format: `"Book Title - Days Borrowed"`.
  - Calculates the most and least borrowed book based on the number of days.
  - Calculates the average number of days books were borrowed.
  - Finds unique titles of all borrowed books.
  - Sorts books by the number of days borrowed in descending order.
- **Concepts Used**:
  - Dictionaries
  - Sets
  - String manipulation
  - Sorting
- **Solution File**: [`library_book_analysis.py`](./library_book_analysis.py)

### 3. Word Scramble Game
- **Description**:
  - Randomly selects a word from a predefined list and scrambles its letters.
  - Players have 5 attempts to guess the original word.
  - Provides feedback for each guess and reveals the correct word if attempts run out.
- **Concepts Used**:
  - Random number generation
  - Loops
  - Conditional statements
  - Exception handling
- **Solution File**: [`word_scramble_game.py`](./word_scramble_game.py)
